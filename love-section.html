Their bond grew stronger over the years, and in 10th grade, they realized their feelings for each other. What followed was a beautiful relationship that lasted for 3.5 years, filled with moments of joy, sadness, and unforgettable memories.

                Vaishnavi was like a queen‚Äîkind, supportive, and always there for Imran. Together, they faced every challenge, celebrated every happiness, and built a love story that felt unbreakable.
                
                But life had different plans. Nine months ago, Vaishnavi got married to someone else. Now, they no longer talk, but the time they spent together remains a golden chapter in Imran‚Äôs heart. No matter where life takes them, those memories will always be special. üíï</p>

Swati, a dedicated nurse, and Irfan started talking casually, but soon their connection deepened into something truly special. Over time, their love grew stronger, and they shared a beautiful relationship that lasted for 5 to 6 years.

                However, life took an unexpected turn‚ÄîSwati got married. But even though their paths diverged, their hearts never did. They still love each other, and though they only talk sometimes, their bond remains unshaken.
                
                Right now, they are going through a very difficult phase due to personal reasons. Yet, despite the distance and the struggles, their love continues to exist‚Äîhidden in unspoken words, silent prayers, and memories that refuse to fade.
